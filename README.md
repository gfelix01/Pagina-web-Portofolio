# Portafolio
Descripci√≥n del Repositorio: Mi Portafolio

This repository houses my personal portfolio, a collection of my most outstanding works and projects in the field of web development. The portfolio has been carefully designed to highlight my skills, experience and creativity.

In this repository, you'll find an organized structure of files and folders that represent each project in my portfolio. Each project includes a concise description, screenshots or links to live demos, as well as the corresponding source code.

The projects in my portfolio make use of various technologies and tools, including:

HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and styling of the pages.

JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic functionality on the client.

jQuery to simplify event handling and DOM manipulation.

PHP for server-side programming and connecting to databases.

MySQL as a relational database management system.

Bootstrap for fast and responsive interface development.

XAMPP to set up a local server and test projects locally.

My goal in sharing my portfolio on GitHub is to provide visitors with a clear and comprehensive view of my work, as well as invite collaboration and receive constructive feedback to improve my skills and projects.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and discover the various projects I have done. If you have any questions, suggestions or interest in collaborating, do not hesitate to contact me!
